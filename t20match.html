                                <hr>Previous stadiums Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of India's
                                (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests. Construction Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium,[4]and the Bombay Cricket Association
                                (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for cricket matches.[5] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the
                                secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co
                                as the contractors. It was named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[6] Since then, Wankhede

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b> Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost. At the arena Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to score 10,000 runs in the Test cricket, he accomplished
                                the feat against Pakistan in their 1987 tour.[27] In 1983, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1983, and claimed his 432nd Test wicket at the stadium to become the highest wicket-taker in the world
                                in 1995, which broke Sir Richard Hadlee's previous record.[28] In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against South Africa, where the visitors lost 105–223.[29]

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second day's play
                                as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative. The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match,
                                for the third time in an otherwise illustrious career.

                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same.

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b>
                                <hr>1982–2006 Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost.

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                                <hr>Previous stadiums Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of India's
                                (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests. Construction Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium,[4]and the Bombay Cricket Association
                                (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for cricket matches.[5] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the
                                secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co
                                as the contractors. It was named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[6] Since then, Wankhede

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>
                                <hr>1982–2006 Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost.

                            <p><b>History</b>The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second day's play
                                as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative. The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match,
                                for the third time in an otherwise illustrious career.

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b> Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost. At the arena Sunil Gavaskar became the first batter to score 10,000 runs in the Test cricket, he accomplished
                                the feat against Pakistan in their 1987 tour.[27] In 1983, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1983, and claimed his 432nd Test wicket at the stadium to become the highest wicket-taker in the world
                                in 1995, which broke Sir Richard Hadlee's previous record.[28] In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring Test match against South Africa, where the visitors lost 105–223.[29]

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                                <hr>Previous stadiums Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of India's
                                (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests. Construction Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium,[4]and the Bombay Cricket Association
                                (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for cricket matches.[5] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the
                                secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co
                                as the contractors. It was named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[6] Since then, Wankhede

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b>Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost

                            <p><b>History</b> In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19] Renovations In June
                                2010, reconstruction work of the stadium was taken up at the cost of ₹175 crore (US$21 million).[20][21] The plan consisted of constructing three new reinforced concrete stands designated I, J, and K accommodating 12,000
                                spectators and 24 hospitality boxes under translucent PTFE membrane roofs.[22] Hopkins Architects, London and Nataraj & Venkat Architects, Chennai were assigned contract by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.[9] The renovation
                                was completed in 2011 and the old roofing with pillars that often blocked the view of spectators in the old stadium were replaced by light quad conical roofing held together by cables. The stadium could accommodate 50,000
                                spectators after the reconstruction.[23][24] The stands are at a gradient of 36° and lets the sea breeze in to get the ground's traditional swing back.[25] On 31 March 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the renovation violates
                                regulations relating to public safety.[26][27] The court ruled that the parts of the renovation which violate the regulations must be demolished and until the appropriate planning permissions are issued and the demolition
                                is complete, three stands (I, J, K) must remain sealed.[28][29] After their construction, cricket matches took place in the stadium with the I, J, and K stands locked for spectators. The stands were finally de-sealed and
                                opened in March 2020.[30] In December 2021, the old Anna pavilion, Anna pavilion stand and MCC clubhouse were demolished to make way for a new pavilion and new stands.[31] The demolition reduced capacity to 31,140.[32]
                                Along with this, temporary seating and standing were removed and permanent seating was installed settling the capacity at 38,200.[31][1][2] This was done at a cost of ₹139 crore ($16.9 million).

                            <p><b>History</b>The Sawai Mansingh Stadium has hosted a solitary Test match, between India and Pakistan, starting in February 1987, when Pakistan President General Zia-ul-Haq crossed the border to watch the second day's play
                                as part of his "Cricket for Peace" initiative. The Test was notable for Younis Ahmed's return to the Test fray after an absence of over 17 years and also for Sunil Gavaskar's dismissal to the first ball of the Test match,
                                for the third time in an otherwise illustrious career.

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                                <hr>Previous stadiums Mumbai has seen Test matches played at three different grounds. The Mumbai Gymkhana ground hosted the first-ever Test in India, in 1933–34 against England. After World War II, the Cricket Club of India's
                                (CCI) Brabourne Stadium – the second ground of the city – was used for 17 Tests. Construction Wankhede Stadium was built after disputes between the CCI, which owns Brabourne Stadium,[4]and the Bombay Cricket Association
                                (BCA; now Mumbai Cricket Association) over the allocation of tickets for cricket matches.[5] This became severe after the Test between India and England in 1973. At the initiative of S. K. Wankhede, a politician and the
                                secretary of the Mumbai Cricket Association, BCA built the new stadium in South Bombay (now South Mumbai) near the Churchgate station by appointing Shashi Prabhu & Associates as their architects and B.E. Billimoria & Co
                                as the contractors. It was named after Wankhede in 1974.[citation needed] It was built in approximately 13 months and opened in time for the final Test between India and the West Indies in 1975.[6] Since then, Wankhede

                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same.

                                in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India.[2][3] It is primarily used for international cricket matches. The stadium has two-tiers and was designed to avoid any restricted views, eliminating pillars or columns which come
                                in the field of view of spectators. The pitch is known to be batsman-friendly.

                            <p><b>History</b>Before the stadium was built, HCA hosted domestic and international matches at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground's proprietor was
                                the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh state (Now Sports Authority of Telangana State) due to which HCA had limited authority and control over the ground, due to which it decided to built their own stadium.[6] In 2003,
                                the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government[7] of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, then headed by N. Chandrababu Naidu. The proposal was quickly cleared and HCA was allocated a budget for the same. The
                                government also identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal.[8] Most of the funding for the project came after an open auction of the stadium's title was held. Visaka Industries Limited won the auction
                                with a bid price of ₹65,00,00,000. A sum of ₹43,00,00,000 was paid in advance and the stadium was named "Visakha International Cricket Stadium" in 2004.[9]

                            <p><b>History</b>
                                <hr>1982–2006 Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar Patel Stadium, international cricket
                                matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the Government of Gujarat donated a 400,000-square-metre (100-acre)
                                stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted
                                here. In the 1984-85 Australia India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which India lost.

                            <p><b>History</b>The first Test match at this venue was played on 10 November 1948 when India took on the West Indies. Records In 1952, playing against Pakistan, Hemu Adhikari and Ghulam Ahmed were involved in a record tenth wicket
                                stand of 111 runs – a record that still stands. In 1965, S Venkataraghavan, in his debut series, demolished the New Zealand line up with figures of 8 for 72 and 4 for 80. In 1969–70, Bishen Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna
                                combined to spin India to a famous seven wicket win over Australia, the duo picking 18 wickets between themselves.[9] In 1981, Geoff Boycott surpassed Gary Sobers' world record test aggregate.

                            <p><b>History</b>In 1859, Madras Presidency acquired Chepauk palace in an auction for ₹589,000.[16][6] In 1865, the government gave permission to build a pavilion at the palace grounds to Madras Cricket Club. The pavilion was
                                finished in 1866. The pavilion was reconstructed in 1892[17] and was utilized till 1982 when it was demolished as part of the stadium renovation.[6] Chepauk Stadium was established in 1916 and has been the home venue of
                                the Tamil Nadu cricket team ever since.[11] It is the second oldest cricket stadium in the country after Eden Gardens in Kolkata, still holding all international cricket matches. Bombay Gymkhana being the first is not in
                                use for international cricket. From 1960 to 1988, Chennai hosted a Test match in the second week of January which was termed the Pongal Test, as it coincided with the Pongal harvest festival.[18][19]

                            <p><b>History</b>The Arun Jaitley Stadium is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz
                                Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29
                                ODIs and 6 T20I. In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam
                                Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.[4] On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister
                                Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. DDCA president Rajat Sharma said: "It was Arun Jaitley's support and encouragement that players like Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Ashish Nehra, Rishabh Pant
